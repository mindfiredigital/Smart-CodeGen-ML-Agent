## Future Work
- **Conversessional** - Make it conversessional so that it can remember previous answers.
- **Retry Code generation** - If generated code is not able to create good model and accuracy or get any run time error then it will generate the code again.
- **Natural Language Query Expansion** – Improve understanding of complex queries with better semantic parsing.   
- **Custom Agent Plugins** – Allow developers to add their own agents or extend existing ones.  
- **Error Recovery Enhancements** – Smarter debugging and auto-repair of failing code without manual intervention.   
- **Support for Multiple LLM Providers** – Integrate with OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Hugging Face, and others in addition to AWS Bedrock.  
- **Benchmarking & Performance Metrics** – Include evaluation metrics for speed, accuracy, and resource usage.
